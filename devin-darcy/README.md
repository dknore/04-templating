# Project Name:  Templating

**Author**: Devin Cunningham and Darcy Knore
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is designed to render articles with consistent formatting so that the user can visit the site often and have the same experience each time, and so that the owner can render articles using a template so that they can easily edit the way articles are rendered.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user can easily clone down the github repo and open it in a web browser.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used HTML, and CSS for the structure and styling of our application, and javascript for function.  We also used jQuery, and handlebar libraries for brevity of code, and templating. With the user experience in mind, the application layout was thoughtfully organized, easy to read, and able to be executed efficiently.

## Change Log
